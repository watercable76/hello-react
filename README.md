## Description
Creating multiple web pages with React.js.  

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Purpose 
I will be creating multiple web pages for this tutorial. This may become a future template for  
the Acorn Project for the CSEE/CIT department.

# Development Environment

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Tools Used

The text editor I used is Visual Studio Code, as well as GitHub. I downloaded Git and connected the repo  
to my VS Code. This way I can write content while ensuring it works and is visually easier to work with. 

Since React.js is a JS framework, I worked mainly with JavaScript, but also had embedded JSX, which is  
JavaScript XML. XML is similar to HTML elements, but is more for data storage. I have never heard of XML  
before working with this, so I suggest looking up more about XML because I cannot explain it well right now.

### Starting with React.js
1. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)  

Running a file:
* Create the new react app by running this:
    1. `npx create-react-app my-app`  
    2. `cd my-app`  
    3. `npm start`  
* These will create the folder, create the app, and then you will change to that new folder.    
* `npm start` will run the project locally.  

I went through a tutorial on React.js [here](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-react-js-5/getting-started-with-react?u=2153100)  
which is through LinkedIn Learning. This was a great introduction to working with components, classes, objects and  
what is React.js. I recommend this tutorial for other people, and if they don't have access to LinkedIn Learning,  
the tutorials from the [React website](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) is really good. It covers all the basics  
of React. I wanted to know more about how to start up a react project, and the LinkedIn Learning course covered that better  
for me, but it's up to personal preference.

## Programming Language
React.js was the programming language for this tutorial. I advise looking at the getting_started.md or resources.md  
files for tutorials and more information.
